/*
Challenge 1: Where it says quality.put(), change the string text (i.e. mint) to 
            enumerated versions (Condition.MINT) instead.

Challenge 2: add two more conditions/enumerations.
        Create a PRISTINE_MINT condition where it sells for 5 times the price,
        and a COVERLESS that sells for 0.1 times the price.
        Then create two new comics that use those conditons.
        NOTE: Remember you have to change the size of the comix array.

Challenge 3: Create an ArrayList to store comics rather than a normal array 
            so that you don't need to resize the array every time you add a new comic.
            Look at the ListExample.java to learn how to make an array list and add values to it.
            
            Display the contents of your new Array List by using a method. 
            Copy the for-loop in the main code below and paste it into the method - remember to change the name comix1
